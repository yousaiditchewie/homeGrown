####homeGrown inspiration

I know many people who have trees in their backyards that eventually are so full of fruit, they have no idea what to do with all of it.  

homeGrown will connect people with similar problems and allow them to share and barter their excess goods.  

As of now, homeGrown is just an API, but soon, it will be a full-stack app that with a plethora of features such as: 

* facilitate food-swaps (meetups)
* suggest neutral meetup locations such as parks and caf√©s
* show available meetups by location 
* show all goods that will be present at each meetup 
* allow users to blog about their meetups
* post pictures from meetups
* post recipes with ingredients from meetups
* allow users to comminicate directly with others attending the same meetup
* allow users to rate other users for peer accountability
* allow users to mark blog posts and messages as "innappropriate" 
* impliment systems for disabling and/or suspending accounts with low ratings
* provide admin rights for developers to maintain the database
